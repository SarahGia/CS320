To make sure that my code works well and is secure, I test it frequently and use things like input validation to catch problems early. I also try to follow the best coding practices and keep everything updated. When it comes to user needs, I focus on understanding their requirements by asking questions after reviewing what is asked and then using their feedback to build what they need. For designing software, I like to break it into smaller parts, map out how it will all work, and keep it simple so it is easier to make changes later.
